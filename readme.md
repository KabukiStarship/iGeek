## Mission and Vision

The mission of iGeek is to make it easier to build, test, and compare AI Agents from bare-metal to the Cloud. The vision of iGeek is to create a portable robotics simulator that can also be used for games and scientific computing.

## Organization

iGeek is built with [Script2](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/Script2), [Kabuki Toolkit](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiToolkit), and [ScriptTek](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/ScriptTek). Currently this repo has no work done on it, but there has been a moderate amount of work done on VirusWorld in Java that was never ported, but we're using SFML now.
